      Reasons:
        - Unit tests might pass locally but not in the CI environment during the status check process or vice-versa.

      The type of release depends on where the release notes are stored.
      - [Preview Release Notes](../../Documentation/ReleaseNotes/PreviewReleases) go into the `~/Documentation/ReleaseNotes/PreviewReleases` folder.
      - [Production Release Notes](../../Documentation/ReleaseNotes/ProductionReleases) go into the `~/Documentation/ReleaseNotes/ProductionReleases` folder.

      Also, any changes such as release notes and version updates should be committed to the release branch being released.
