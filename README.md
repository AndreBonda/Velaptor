<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center" >!! NOTICE !!</h2>

This library is still under development and is not at v1.0.0 yet!!  All of the major features are there though so we encourage you to use it and report back any issues and improvements you may have.  That is what open source is all about.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">üìñ About Velaptor</h2>

Velaptor is a 2D game development framework written in modern C# that strives to be simple and easy to use.  Game development can be difficult.  This is why using a framework that takes care of all of the lower level, more complicated things to creating a game can help!!  Things such as playing sound, loading graphics, managing content, multi-platform, and dealing with input are just some of the things that a game framework can provide.  This way you can just concentrate on developing your game or multi-media application.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">‚ú®Features</h2>

### Cross-Platform
We strive for **Velaptor** to be a cross platform library by running under **.NET v5.0**.  There are plans for this library to continually be updated as we approach **.NET 6.0** and beyond.

### Easy to use
One of the goals of this library is to make sure that the it is easy to use.  Everything from naming, documentation and the usability of the how API needs to be simple and easy.

### Flexible Content Loading System
**Velaptor** has the ability to load texture atlas image and JSON data for texture atlas type rendering as well as single image content and sound content.  The content loading system is flexible and has an API that has the ability to be extended to load custom content for your media applications and games.

### Content Caching
Loaded content such as images and sounds are cached for reuse and performance reasons.  If the same content is loaded from disk after it has already been loaded, the same image content will be used for rendering.  This is the same for sounds and texture atlas data.  Custom content loading will not come with caching and will have to be added.

**Velaptor** encourages and uses [Early Pull Requests](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6). Please don't wait until you're finished with your work before creating a PR.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch following the feature branch section in the documentation [here](./Documentation/Branching.md)
3. Add an empty commit to the new feature branch to start your work off.
   * Use this git command: `git commit --allow-empty -m "start work for issue #<issue-number-here>"`
   * Example: `git commit --allow-empty -m "start work for issue #123"`
4. Once you've pushed a commit, open a [**draft pull request**](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). Do this **before** you actually start working.
5. Make your commits in small, incremental steps with clear descriptions.
6. All unit tests must pass before a PR will be completed.
7. Make sure that the code follows the the coding standards.
   * Pay attention to the warnings in **Visual Studio**!!
   * Refer to the *.editorconfig* files in the code base for rules
8. Tag a maintainer when you're done and ask for a review!

If you have any questions, contact a project maintainer.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Practices</h2>

- The code base is highly tested using unit testing while maintaining a high level of code coverage.  Manual testing is performed using the included testing application built specifically for manually testing the library.  When contributing, make sure to add or adjust the unit tests appropriately regarding your changes and perform manual testing.
- We use a combination of [StyleCop](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers) and [Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers) libraries for maintaining coding standards.
   - We understand that there are some exceptions to the rule and not all coding standards fit every situation.  In these scenarios, contact a maintainer and lets discuss it!!  Warnings can always be suppressed if need be.
- We use [semantic versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) for versioning.
