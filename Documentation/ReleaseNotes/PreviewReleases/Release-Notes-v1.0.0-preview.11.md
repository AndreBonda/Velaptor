<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New Features ‚ú®</h2>

1. [#247](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/247) - Created a logging system for logging various information.
   - Automatically creates 2 different types of logs in a **_logs_** directory in the same directory as the application.
   - Standard logs for logging misc. info, warnings, and errors are logged into a text file that is prefixed with **_logs-_** and ending with a date in the format _yyyyMMdd_.
   - Each day will have a log file.
   - An event log file for logging events only is logged into a text file that is prefixed with **_event-logs-_** and ends with a date with the format _yyyyMMdd_.
   - Logging settings are set in the app settings file named **_app-settings.json_** which is located in the same directory as the application.
   - Use the settings below to set up the type of logging behavior.  
     These can be set to `true` or `false` to enable and disable them.
     - LoggingEnabled
     - ConsoleLoggingEnabled
     - FileLoggingEnabled
2. [#248](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/248) - Created an application settings system.
   - Added the ability to manage application settings.  This can also be expanded upon in the future.
   - Added the ability to set the default window width and height when the application is executed.
   - Added a new method overload named `CreateWindow()` with no parameters to the `App` class.  This method uses the app settings to determine the window width and height instead of 2 parameters.
