## <span style='color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold'>Velaptor Preview Release Notes - v1.0.0-preview.3</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Greatly improved the testing application to help improve the process of manual testing
2. Created scene management system with various scenes for the testing application
   * Added a scene to test text rendering
   * Added a scene to test mouse functionality
   * Added a scene to test keyboard functionality
   * Added a scene to test graphics rendering
   * Created a simple scene management system to help easily add new scenes to the testing application
3. Created new abstract control base class named `Velaptor.UI.ControlBase` for the purpose of creating custom controls
4. Created new `Velaptor.UI.Label` control
5. Created new `Velaptor.UI.Button` control
6. Created new `Velaptor.UI.Textbox` control
   * Warning!! - This control is not finished and needs some work
7. Added ability to `IContent` items to know if they have been created using **_Velaptor's_*** content pooling system.
   * This ability gives the user the ability to know if a content item was created and added tot he pooling system vs created as a custom instantiation by the user.
8. Add 2 new properties to the controls
   * `MouseHoverColor` - This is the color that is applied on top of the control during rendering when the mouse hovers over the control.
   * `MouseDown` - This is the color that is applied on top of the control during rendering when the left mouse button is in the down position over a control.
9.  Added new boolean property named `IsPooled` to the `IContent` interface and all implementation members
    * This property value is true if it was created using **_Velaptor's__** content creation system
10. Created new exception type named `PooledDisposalException`
   * This exception is thrown if an `IContent` item is being disposed when it was created with **_Velaptor's_** content creation system which uses content pooling for performance
   * NOTE: To know if an item was created in a pool, query the boolean value of the `IContent.IsPooled` property
11. Added ability to `IContent` items to throw an exception of type `PooledDisposalException`
12. Added ability for the content loaders below to take in a content name with or without and extension.
    * NOTE: If a content name contains an extension, it is simply ignored.
    * `AtlasLoader`
    * `FontLoader`
    * `TextureLoader`
    * `SoundLoader` - This loader has not been updated to do this.  There are plans to make some changes to the `ISound` type in **_Velaptor_** which will possibly require some changes to the **_CASL_** library.  Coming soon!!

### **Bug Fixes** üêõ

1. Fixed a bug with the `MapValue` extension method
2. Fixed a bug with where clearing the screen to a set color was not working
   * This was a bug with the `ISpriteBatch.Clear()` method implementation
3. Fixed a bug where in rare cases, the mouse setup process would try to duplicate setup of the mouse buttons causing an exception
   * This issue might actually of never occurred but was discovered during unit testing
4. Fixed some bugs with how `IContent` items were being disposed in UI controls and scenes

### **Nuget/Library Additions** üì¶

1. Added nuget package **_Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers v5.0.3_**
   * This is for the purpose for code analysis during development
2. Added nuget package **_StyleCop.Analyzers v1.1.118_**
   * This is for the purpose for code analysis during development

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Removed the following classes/types
   * `RenderText`
   * `UIText`
2. Refactored any public members in the code base that ended with **_ID_** to end with **_Id_** instead
   * This was to maintain consist clean code throughout the code base
3. Changed the constructor of the `Velaptor.UI.Window` class from **_public_** to **_protected_**
4. Moved the types below from the `Velaptor.Graphics` namespace to the `Velaptor.Content` namespace
   * `IAtlasData`
   * `AtlasData`
   * `IFont`
   * `Font`
   * `ITexture`
   * `Texture`
5. Change the classes below to be sealed:
   * NOTE: This was done to make sure to now allow new types to inherit from these lower level library types.  This is to make sure that the content pooling and **_OpenGL_** calls do not put the system into a state of being unstable.  If user wants to create custom controls and content types, take advantage of all the various interfaces to do this as it was built for this. 
   * `AtlasData`
   * `AtlasLoader`
   * `ContentLoader`
   * `Font`
   * `FontLoader`
   * `Sound`
   * `SoundLoader`
   * `Texture`
   * `TextureLoader`
   * `Button`
   * `Label`

### **Improvements** üåü

1. Cleanup and refactoring of inline XML code documentation throughout entire library.
2. Refactoring to help aline code base with coding standards

### **CI/CD** üöÄ

1. Created workflow to automatically add triage labels to new and reopened issues
   * Contribution made by [@teezzan](https://github.com/teezzan) - Thanks!! üôè
2. Fixed an issue with the **_QA_** and **_Production_** workflow template
   * This was a syntax error preventing the workflow from running

### **Other** üëè

1. Increased code coverage
2. Miscellaneous cleanup and refactoring to meet coding standards
