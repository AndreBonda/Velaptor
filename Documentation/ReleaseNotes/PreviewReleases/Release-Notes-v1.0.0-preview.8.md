<h2 align="center" style='font-weight:bold'>Quick Reminder</h2>

As with all software, including releases, there is always a chance for issues and bugs.  It is also common to miss changes in the release notes when there are many.  This is even more common in preview releases.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New üéâ</h2>

1. Added new constructor to `CornerRadius` struct for convenience.  
   GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
    * This makes it easier to set all of the radius values to the same value.
2. Added a new property named `HalfWidth` to the `RectShape` struct.  
   GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
3. Added a new property named `HalfHeight` to the `RectShape` struct.  
   GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
4. Added a new property named `Top` to the `RectShape` struct to get or set the location of the top of the rectangle.  
   GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
    * This will automatically update the `Position` property of the rectangle.
5. Added a new property named `Right` to the `RectShape` struct to get or set the location of the right side of the rectangle.  
   GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
    * This will automatically update the `Position` property of the rectangle.
6. Added a new property named `Bottom` to the `RectShape` struct to get or set the location of the bottom of the rectangle.  
   GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
    * This will automatically update the `Position` property of the rectangle.
1.  Added a new property named `Left` to the `RectShape` struct to get or set the location of the left side of the rectangle.  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
    * This will automatically update the `Position` property of the rectangle.
1.  Added new `System.Drawing.Color` extension method named `IncreaseBrightness()` to increase the brightness of the color.  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
9.  Added new `System.Drawing.Color` extension method named `DecreaseBrightness()` to decrease the brightness of the color.  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
10. Changed the `ControlBase.Width` and `ControlBase.Height` property setters from `protected internal` to `public`  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
11. Added property named `AutoSize` to the `Label` control.  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
    * When set to `true`, the label's `Width` and `Height` will automatically be set based on the width and height of the rendered text.  When set to `false`, `Width` and `Height` are independent of the rendered text size.
12. Added new property named `AutoSize` to the `Button` control.  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
    * When set to `true`, the button's `Width` and `Height` will automatically be set based on the width and height of the button text.  When set to `false`, `Width` and `Height` are independent of the button text size.
13. Added new method to the `IFont` interface and `Font` class that returns the bounds of each character of some given text relative to a position.  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
14. Added the ability to add a `Label` to a `Button`.  This can be done by sending in a `Label` instance into the `Button` constructor.  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
15. Added additional constructors to the `Button` class to improve the ease of use when creating new buttons.  List of new constructors listed below.  
    GitHub Issues: [#196](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/196)
    * `Button(Label label)`
    * `Button(uint width, uint height)`
    * `Button(uint width, uint height, Label label)`
    * `Button(Point position, uint width, uint height)`
    * `Button(Point position, uint width, uint height, Label label)`

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Breaking Changes üí£</h2>

1. Changed the order of rendering from textures, text, then rectangle primitives to textures, rectangle primitives, then text.
2. Changed the behavior of the `RectShape.BorderThickness` and `RectShape.CornerRadius` properties
    * Previously, both properties would check the incoming value and restrict them to a limit of the smallest value between the half width or half height.  This was done to prevent any unintended rendering artifacts when rendering rectangles.  This behavior was removed from the `RectShape` and moved to the internal `RectGPUBuffer` class.  These checks and restrictions now occur right before sending the data to the GPU.
3. Changed the `ControlBase.IsLoaded` property from `protected` to `private`.
    * The property was meant to be updated via the `ControlBase.LoadContent()` method.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Internal Changes ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>

1. Created new extension method named `ToVector2()` that converts a `System.Drawing.Point` type to the `System.Numerics.Vector2` type
2. Created new extension method named `ToPoint()` that converts a `System.Numerics.Vector2` type to the `System.Drawing.Point` type

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Nuget/Library Updates üì¶</h2>

1. Update nuget package **SixLabors.ImageSharp** library from **_v1.0.3_** to **_v2.0.0_**  
   GitHub Issues: [#204](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/204)
    - This is what fixed the texture rendering issue
